middle of console -> need to come up with way to pause the command when hit enter,
but enter can still be inputted when waiting for command

-> need to configure what happens when waiting for command vs servicing command, etc.
-> game plan: when waiting for command, enter is just the command
-> when servicing command, enter is pause. need a PAUSE command function that can also be called internally.
-> when paused command, q is quit.
